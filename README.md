# Lung Cancer Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on **lung cancer detection** using **CT scans** from the **Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI)**. The goal is to develop robust deep learning models for detecting and diagnosing lung nodules indicative of cancer.

## Dataset Description

The **LIDC-IDRI dataset** serves as a benchmark for developing computer-assisted diagnostic methods for lung cancer detection. It contains **annotated thoracic CT scans** reviewed by expert radiologists.

- **Total Patients:** 1,010
- **Data Types:**  
  - **Diagnostic (DX)**
  - **Computed Tomography (CT)**
  - **Chest Radiography (CR)**
- **Cancer Categories:**  
  - Lung Cancer  
  - Non-Cancer  
  - Metastatic Disease
- **Total Images:** 244,527
- **Total Dataset Size:** 133.16 GB
- **Annotations:**  
  - Provided in **XML format** by radiologists through a two-phase review process.
